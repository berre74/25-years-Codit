# 25 Years Codit

## Dear Codit'er

It's exactly **_25 years ago_**, I had to present myself as an **Integration Consultant** with **Microsoft** at **Stora Enso**, **Unilin** and **Danone** ...

## I need a name for my baby

Microsoft asked me to present myself more "as a company", than an "independent consultant".

... I had to find out a name "overnight" :-)))

I came up with **"CODIT"**, of course because I _love_ **coding** ... and **"Integration Technology"** was a "THE next big thing" for companies and organizations to become more efficient.

When I first spoke out the name _"CODIT"_ in a meeting with Microsoft and a first prospect, the customer immediately said: _"CODIT ??? Oh yeah ! Already heard about them !!!"_

... which was of course IMPOSSIBLE :-)))

On that precise moment, I knew : we got a very good company-name !!!

## And ... here we GO !

This year, CODIT will have exactly the same age as my second doughter ... often, people asked me: _"could you let go your baby ???"_

The thing is: a company is NOT a baby ... I wouldn't of course leave my 2 wonderfull daughters Olivia and Marilou, who always believed in me and supported me in my professionel career, even in though times (in 2007, more precisely).

But a company needs a different way of management, depending of its maturity and market-strategy. It was time to find a reliable partner for Codit going forward !

## What a journey

I remember of course very well starting to engaging more and more people on board of Codit, as our business grew steadily during the first years. But I NEVER would have dreamt of such a huge and beautifull team of so smart people !

It took nearly 20 years, but the team grew to 200+ in 7+ different countries ... (even for a short while in Vietnam !!! did you know ???).

What a pleasure to exchange new ideas and thoughts in think-tank meetings and other architectural design reviews. Always trying to do things better, cheaper and faster than competitors ! Being a real game changer and strategic partner for our customers !

These values will always remain in Codit: it's in our DNA: "Quality first, Quantity will come automatically" ... Always learning something new, being curious, passionated about new technologies ... it's been a never ending story ... and will remain as long humanity will exist ! Someone said: "Aim for the stars !"

## Not the end, a new begin

So, We did sold to company to Proximus in 2018 ... but never really abandonned it ... we believe Proximus will take the right decisions for the next steps of Codit.

## My new projects

A lot of people ask me: _"What are you gonna do next, Bernard ?"_

That's a really though question to answer: when you reach my age (born in 70), you still are curious, still have a lot of energy, a lot of passion, and still keeping up-to-date with new technologies ... but start to realize that live is too short to do everything you would like to do ... choosing is loosing ...

So I started a few projects, I couldn't realize being too busy with Codit.

One of my passions, next to technology, is flying: I started last year with my private pilot license. Another "world", full of interesting and passionated people !

Meanwhile I keep working out: mainly mountain trail running and bycicle riding, takes a lot of my time as well. It keeps my fit, young and keeps my mind creative (and young I guess) !

Be my guest if you would like to share any of these moments together, it would be a real pleasure for me ! Going from a technology-chat to some more sport-action together ... even a mix of both is fun !!!

## Thanks &#9829; !!!

It's time of course to express my gratitude for your commitment and dedication to Codit. It's been a real pleasure to work together and hope to work again with you in the future.

Although I'm leaving Codit, all the good memories and **the friendship** will remain forever !!!

Let's stay in contact: [here](#contacts).

I hope to see you all on the 25-years Codit Party on Sat 15th of March 2025 !
